# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

I created a program (using HTML, CSS and Javascript) to create a fully responsive web app to play a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

You pick a choice by clicking on one of the three button options. The browser randomly generates a choice and decides who wins.

I had created a similar project with a very minimal user interface, this proect was intended to have a clean minimal interface.
